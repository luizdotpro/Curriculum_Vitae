## Developer self-disclosure: 

> Dear reader, 

> my name is Luiz and I am a Ph.D. in natural sciences (Physics) who found great joy in programming. By now, I have two years of professional experience as a software developer, though I have been coding for the last ten years. In this period, I wrote Fortran, Python, IDL, Latex mainly to analyse data, publish results, and finish my Ph.D thesis. Lately, I am focussing on Typescript, which is a typed superset of Javascript.

>Professionally,  React Native and React Web have been my playground. I used NextJS to publish an AMP website, which was the first product of the company to use end to end tests with Cypress and was a project managed entirely by me alone. These days, I am working on a NodeJs application which will be the first company's product with GraphQL. In parallel, I continuously write cross-platform components, meaning code libraries to be used on the web as also on mobile. 

>One of the challenges in cross-platform development is to achieve appearance consistency in different environments. It is not only about responsiveness, but the basis that guides style in web and mobile applications is different. That leads to Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) problems which sometimes seem senseless. Remarking that in my early days as a professional developer, made me focus on the fundamentals of styling applications. That turned out to be very helpful for writing small elements responsible for styling logic depending on where the application is built. It brings also an optimisation in development time since the bigger components can handle other complexities, but the styles are fixed and centralised.

>A couple of months after that, when my department was moving from Javascript to Typescript, we quickly met a time-consuming problem. At some point, some procedures had to be run depending on an object type. In other words, the object's interface had to be verified before the next line of code. As more than one person on the team had the same problem, I was very excited to find a solution. I decided then to read the whole Typescript documentation since It was a predictable issue. The complexity solution is called type guards. It skips the scope of this text to explain the solution details. After that happened, I started to read the documentation of technologies before even encountering a problem. There is always at least a minimal new feature to be learned.

>My happiness in programming will always be followed by challenges as described above. Meanwhile, It is clear to me that communication plays a key role in understanding problems and finding solutions. That is why I make what is possible to improve my connection with my peers and make everyone's woking hours more enjoyable and productive.
